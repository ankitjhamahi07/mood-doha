Build a full-stack web app with a **minimal, spiritual UI** where users choose a mood from a cloud, and receive a matching Kabir Doha. The app should feel calm, text-focused, and flow smoothly with subtle animations.

---

🎯 App Flow:

1. Homepage shows a clean, centered **mood cloud** of 30–50 moods (e.g., calm, restless, joyful, curious).
2. When the user clicks a mood:
   - Use a smooth **fade/slide animation** to transition to the result screen.
   - Display a **Kabir Doha**:
     - In **Hindi (Devanagari)** — large, centered.
     - With **transliteration** in Latin script below it.
     - Followed by the **English translation**.
3. Add a **“Next Doha”** button to get another one for the same mood.
4. Optionally include a **“Back to moods”** button with a slide or fade effect.

🎨 UI / Design Instructions:

- Use **TailwindCSS**.
- Color palette: neutral base (`#fdfcf9`), dark text (`#1a1a1a`), one highlight color (sage, saffron, or sky).
- **Typography**:
  - Hindi: `Noto Sans Devanagari` or `Tiro Devanagari Hindi`
  - English: `Noto Serif`, `Inter`, or `Playfair Display`
- Mood cloud: center-aligned, floating **pill-shaped buttons**, hover + tap effect.
- Layout: vertically and horizontally centered, full height, max-width centered container.

🎞️ Smooth Animation Instructions:

- Use **Framer Motion** or **Tailwind + Headless UI transitions**.
- Animate:
  - Mood cloud → fade out and slide up on selection
  - Doha view → fade in with slight delay
  - "Next Doha" button → fade content out, load new Doha, fade in
- Transitions should be **soft, slow (~300–500ms)**, easing = `ease-in-out`
- No jarring or flashy effects — everything should feel like a mindful transition.
