Refine the mood cloud section to make it visually beautiful and culturally rich. It should feel spiritual and artistic, like a blend of a Vedic manuscript and a mindfulness app. Keep it elegant and mobile-friendly.

Enhance the design as follows:

🌿 **Layout & Placement:**
- Center the mood cloud both vertically and horizontally.
- Use a responsive grid with natural spacing and wrap.
- Allow some floating variation in button size (like a real "cloud").

🎨 **Mood Button Design:**
- Use **pill-shaped buttons** with soft gradients or light textures (linen, parchment).
- Apply gentle shadows or border glows using colors like saffron, teal, maroon, or indigo.
- Add **hover/tap animations**: gentle scale (1.05x) with `ease-in-out`, maybe a glowing border or ripple.
- Font should be soft and elegant (`Inter`, `Tiro Devanagari`, `Playfair Display`).

🕉️ **Vedic / Ethnic Visual Elements:**
- Add a **subtle background motif**: faded mandala, lotus, diya, or peepal leaf (SVG or PNG), placed behind or around the cloud.
- Consider light **border ornaments** (like temple arch patterns or floral vines) around the mood cloud container.
- Add a **decorative title** like “Choose Your State of Mind” in Sanskrit-inspired font or style.

🪄 **Transitions & Animations:**
- When the mood cloud loads, animate the tags softly with staggered fade-in and float.
- Add slight floating animation to each tag (e.g., vertical oscillation by 1–2px) to make it feel alive.
- On mood selection, fade the cloud away gently and slide into the Doha view.

🎨 **Color Palette Suggestions:**
- Background: `#fefcf9` or `#fffaf3`
- Accents: muted saffron, rose gold, temple red, indigo blue
- Add very soft gold or copper texture if possible (with opacity < 0.1)

📱 **Mobile Optimization:**
- Ensure all mood buttons are large enough for touch.
- Use a collapsible cloud or scrollable grid if needed.

The final result should feel immersive, sacred, and inviting — like the start of a spiritual journey. No harsh shadows or modern UI distractions — think **temple courtyard meets poetry scroll**.
